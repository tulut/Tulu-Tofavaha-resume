        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a freshman at University of California,Riverside. I am currently majoring in Sociology/Administrative studies but I hope to transfer into the Pre-law and Society as an upperclassman. I am interested in furthering my interest in law in the future. As a highschooler, I was involved with 2 governmental programs. I had the pleasure of being on the Mock Trial team my senior year working as an attorney which gave me a basic understanding of how a proper court hearing looks like. Being an attorney for my team taught me to think quickly on my feet even in situations that I was not prepared for. I was pushed to learn material in a short amount of time and was responsible for making sure that my colleagues and I were not running into each other's time.I also participated in the YMCA's Youth and Government which is a program that mocks the actual government system led by young students like myself. During my 2 years as a delegate in the Youth and Government program, I met up with my local peers every week to discuss social issues, political topics and also learning basic discussion etiquette. I chose from my peers to represent a bill that we created in response to the rent issues and displacement in cities, such as the one we lived in. As part of the program, we had the honor of working in the state capital buildings and present the bills that we created in the senate chambers. I advocated for the bill that my local peers and I created and was able to pass the bill concerning displacement and rent issues to the House of Representatives where my partner then advocated the same bill. Through this program, I learned many things about the different types of departments there are in the government and what each does. I also created bonds from all over the state with people who also shared the same interests as me. It pushed me to become a better spokesperson and also to be able to feel more comfortable with speaking in front of a large crowd.  Aside from that, I have also been part of many volunteer work such as my local homeless shelter, food shelter, and the YMCA's senior center. Through these volunteer work, I gained a new perspective on the struggles people go through to sustain a stable life. I also became more observant on the issues my community faces and thought more about the things that could be improved to help out those in need. Although I have not had much experience, I have learned to care deeply about changing the justice system in ways that would focus on benefiting those in serious need of help. My passion to want to do better for my community is what pushes me to want to find solutions through policy to fix the current issues I have seen. <br><br>
